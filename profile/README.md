**luarkerja.id** is a GitHub organization focused on building and maintaining digital systems with clean architecture, measurable performance, and long-term sustainability in mind.

This organization serves as a home for internal and public repositories related to web applications, backend systems, and technical tooling.

## Focus Areas

- Web application development  
- Backend & API architecture  
- System design and performance  
- Technical documentation and standards  
- Controlled technical experiments  

## Technical Principles

The following principles guide every project within this organization:

- Clear architecture matters more than fast delivery
- Data flow must be traceable and predictable
- Avoid performance anti-patterns (N+1 queries, over-fetching, uncontrolled state)
- Documentation is part of the system, not an afterthought
- Code should be readable by humans before being executed by machines

## Repository Standards

Repositories in this organization typically include:
- A clear `README.md` describing purpose and scope
- A `docs/` directory for technical documentation
- An `ARCHITECTURE.md` for system-level rules when applicable
- A consistent and modular project structure

## Repository Status

Repositories may be:
- Internal or private
- Experimental
- Public for reference and learning

## Note

This organization prioritizes **design quality, clarity, and maintainability** over repository count.
